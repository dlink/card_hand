Many years ago -- This was a final assignment of my first "Computer Science"
class which was at that time a course in Pascal Computer Programming.  I was
very excited about my solution which was printed out on four or five pages when
I handed it in and my teacher said:

"Yes, great - but now do it with less code."

That stuck with me.  So, here many years later, I took a new stab at it for fun.
